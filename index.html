        The panduri is a traditional folk instrument which originates in the eastern region of the European country Georgia.
        The traditional panduri is considered a three-string lute or plucked instrument with three to seven frets on the fretboard.
        Newer variations, called chromatic panduri or panduri prima and tenor, are made with 12 frets and smaller tonal divisions. 
        These have the capacity to portray different scale systems than the older instrument variations, similar to those of modern guitars.
        This instrument is not typically played with a pick but rather by hand with various theatrical strumming techniques.<br>

    <h2>How does it sound?</h2>
      <p1>
        The panduri is typically an accompaniment instrument, but has also been used for solos of classical pieces.
        It is often played to accompany Georgian polyphonic style singing and used to depict heroic folklore, comical stories, 
        and romantic poems or love songs. It is also popularly used to set the tone of these styles to accompany other Georgian Folk
        instruments such as high pitched wind instruments and hand drums.<br>
        The panduri is a medieval sounding instrument with a colorful, plucky sound. The instrument is warm and rich with multiple voices, depending 
        on how it is played. Overall it is amazing for creating an atmosphere of a distant horizon, a path by which hardship and battle may arise. 
        A skilled artist can use it to portray victory and triumph, solemnity, or merriment.<br>

    <h2>Origin and History of the Panduri</h2>
      <p1>
        The country of Georgia was established in the 1990s but has deeply rooted ancient history passed down from nearly 1.8 million years ago. 
        Prior to the Christianization of the eastern Gerogian kingdom of Iberia (327 A.D), there was a great belief that spirits of sickness called
        batonebi could be warded off with ritual songs of healing and worship. These spirits were said to be controlled by the goddess of the sun who embodied motherhood.
        Lullabies were sung and accompanied by panduri in order to please the batonebi so they wouldn't take ill and diseased children.<br>
