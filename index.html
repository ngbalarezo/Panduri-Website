              <h2>What is a Panduri?</h2>
              <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Panduri_%289%29.jpg/800px-Panduri_%289%29.jpg" width="240" height="160"/>
              <p>
                The panduri is a traditional folk instrument which originates in the European country Georgia.
                It is dominantly found in the eastern regions, namely Pshav-Khevsureti, Tusheti, Kakheti, and Kartli.
                Though it is most commonly found there, it can also be found in the west as well, such as in the Imereti region,
                or highland area Racha.

                The traditional panduri is considered a three-string lute or plucked instrument with three to seven frets on the fretboard.
                Newer variations, called chromatic panduri or panduri prima and tenor, are made with 12 frets and smaller tonal divisions. 
                These have the capacity to portray different scale systems than the older instrument variations, similar to those of modern guitars.
                This instrument is not typically played with a pick but rather by hand with various theatrical strumming techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a wide variety of styles of panduri. Every instrument can be seen differing in shape, size, build, and carved design.
                Shapes tend to depend on the region, ranging from oar shaped, boat shaped, pear shaped, and oval shaped. For example,
                panduri from the Khevsureti region of Georgia are very large and oar shaped. Some panduri can be very small and and boxlike,
                while others can be large and rounded all the way around the back. [!FIXME: insert carve styles/methods]

                The panduri is typically an accompaniment instrument, but has also been used for solos of classical pieces.
                It is often played to accompany Georgian polyphonic style singing and used to depict heroic folklore, comical stories, 
                and romantic poems or love songs. It is also popularly used to set the tone of these styles to accompany other Georgian Folk
                instruments such as high pitched wind instruments and hand drums.<br>
                The panduri is a medieval sounding instrument with a colorful, plucky sound. The instrument is warm and rich with multiple voices, depending 
                on how it is played. Overall it is amazing for creating an atmosphere of a distant horizon, a path by which hardship and battle may arise. 
                A skilled artist can use it to portray victory and triumph, solemnity, or merriment.<br>

              <h2>Origin and History of the Panduri</h2>
              <p>
                [!FIXME: insert intro/ancient pricing]
                The country of Georgia was established in the 1990s but has deeply rooted ancient history passed down from nearly 1.8 million years ago. 
                Prior to the Christianization of the eastern Gerogian kingdom of Iberia (327 A.D), there was a great pagan belief that spirits of sickness called
                batonebi could be warded off with ritual songs of healing and worship. These spirits were said to be controlled by the goddess of the sun who embodied motherhood.
                Lullabies were sung and accompanied by panduri in order to please the batonebi so they wouldn't take ill and diseased children.
                After Christianity came to Georgia the beliefs of the people changed slightly. They came to worship the God of Abraham and the belief of batonebi
                became associated with the saints and God, though they still believed in these spirits. These ritual songs are still preserved today, but are mainly
                centered around pleasing the sick child. It is held today that you may not refuse anything to a sick child, no matter his or her request.
              </p>
              <p>
                The panduri was a ritual and religious symbol as much as a musical instrument. Since they were meant as joyful instruments, they were often put away during 
                the mourning of a loved one who had passed away. The entire village would cease their song and dance for one year to mourn the deceased.
                After one year the head of the household would bring out the instrument and play music to symbolize the end of this period. The whole village could now
                sing their songs and dance in joy and celebration once again. This tradition was so important that the village would refuse song even during religious
                holidays and weddings planned in that year of mourning out of respect for the dead. The closest relative of the departed would have to go into the gathered crowd and
                begin to play cheerfully. Afterwards they would pass the instrument around to others. These advances were refused by the community at first, but eventually someone
                would accept upon many requests from the relative. This ritual, called "Opening Panduri", was an invitation to the village to resume their merriment. The family would
                continue to mourn however.
              </p>
              <p>
                The panduri also went hand in hand with mountain and farm work. For instance, sheperds of old would express themselves in poetic song during their work when joys
                and sorrows arose. They would reach for their instrument and sing poems, even ones about the panduri. This is evident in many Khevsuretian poems: 
                “I sat down and began to make up poems and play Panduri…” “I took you Panduri, sang a song about you!” In these mountainous regions, those who were skilled with
                the instrument were loved dearly and greatly respected among all. No celebrations and occasions of amusement would take place without him. The long and full history
                of this instrument and the beautiful sounds it can produce have led to its preservation through the rocky history of its region of origin. To this day the instrument is 
                handed down and has become popularized on the internet via YouTube and other forums. Modern day artists like Trio Mandili have brought light to the ancient traditions 
                and music in a youthful and harmonious way.
