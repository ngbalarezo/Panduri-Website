                The panduri is a traditional folk instrument which originates in the European country Georgia.
                It is dominantly found in the eastern regions, namely Pshav-Khevsureti, Tusheti, Kakheti, and Kartli.
                Though it is most commonly found there, it can also be found in the west as well, such as in the Imereti region,
                or highland area Racha.

                The traditional panduri is considered a three-string lute or plucked instrument with three to seven frets on the fretboard.
                Newer variations, called chromatic panduri or panduri prima and tenor, are made with 12 frets and smaller tonal divisions. 
                These have the capacity to portray different scale systems than the older instrument variations, similar to those of modern guitars.
                This instrument is not typically played with a pick but rather by hand with various theatrical strumming techniques.

                There is a wide variety of styles of panduri. Every instrument can be seen differing in shape, size, build, and carved design.
                Shapes tend to depend on the region, ranging from oar shaped, boat shaped, pear shaped, and oval shaped. For example,
                panduri from the Khevsureti region of Georgia are very large and oar shaped. Some panduri can be very small and and boxlike,
                while others can be large and rounded all the way around the back. They can be seen all over with varying carved and painted patterns.
                Sometimes the block of wood that was used to make the instrument can have natural cuts and divets that add stylistically to the
                aesthetic of the instrument.

                The panduri is typically an accompaniment instrument, but has also been used for solos of classical pieces.
                It is often played to accompany Georgian polyphonic style singing and used to depict heroic folklore, comical stories, 
                and romantic poems or love songs. It is also popularly used to set the tone of these styles to accompany other Georgian Folk
                instruments such as high pitched wind instruments and hand drums.

                The panduri is a medieval sounding instrument with a colorful, plucky sound. The instrument is warm and rich with multiple voices, depending 
                on how it is played. Overall it is amazing for creating an atmosphere of a distant horizon, a path by which hardship and battle may arise. 
                A skilled artist can use it to portray victory and triumph, solemnity, or merriment.
