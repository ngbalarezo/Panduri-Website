              <h1>Origin and History of the Panduri</h1>
              <p>
                The country of Georgia was established in the 1900s but has deeply rooted ancient history passed down from nearly 1.8 million years ago.
                In the old days the panduri was considered an essential heirloom and accessory in each home. It was unheard of for a family not to have
                this instrument. Panduri were hung on the wall in the common room of the home to be displayed for all to see. When it came time, families
                would gather and sing together. Typically it was the men who would play the panduri, though women would play as well. It was not as 
                common that they were made for commercial sale, but rather panduri were presented as heatfelt gifts.
                Nevertheless, it was possible to purchase these instruments. In the Khevsureti mountain region a panduri would cost the same as one sheep
                or 5kg of melted butter.

              <h2>Ritual and Religious Symbolism</h2>
              <p>
                The panduri was a ritual and religious symbol as much as a musical instrument. Since they were meant as joyful instruments, they were often put away during 
                the mourning of a loved one who had passed away. The entire village would cease their song and dance for one year to mourn the deceased.
                After one year the head of the household would bring out the instrument and play music to symbolize the end of this period. The whole village could now
                sing their songs and dance in joy and celebration once again. This tradition was so important that the village would refuse song even during religious
                holidays and weddings planned in that year of mourning out of respect for the dead. The closest relative of the departed would have to go into the gathered crowd and
                begin to play cheerfully. Afterwards they would pass the instrument around to others. These advances were refused by the community at first, but eventually someone
                would accept upon many requests from the relative. This ritual, called "Opening Panduri", was an invitation to the village to resume their merriment. The family would
                continue to mourn however.

              <p>
                Before the Christianization of the eastern Georgian kingdom of Iberia (327 A.D.), there was a great pagan belief that spirits of sickness called
                Batonebi could be warded off with ritual songs of healing and worship. These spirits were said to be controlled by the goddess of the sun who embodied motherhood.
                Lullabies were sung and accompanied by panduri in order to please the Batonebi so they wouldn't take ill and diseased children.
                After Christianity came to Georgia the beliefs of the people changed slightly. They came to worship the God of Abraham and the belief of Batonebi
                became associated with the saints and God, though they still believed in these spirits. These ritual songs are still preserved today, but are mainly
                centered around pleasing the sick child. It is held today that you may not refuse anything to a sick child, no matter his or her request.

              <h2>Sheperds of Old and Recreation</h2>
              <p>
                The panduri also went hand in hand with mountain and farm work. For instance, sheperds of old would express themselves in poetic song during their work when joys
                and sorrows arose. They would reach for their instrument and sing poems, even ones about the panduri.

              <p>
                This is evident in many Khevsuretian poems: “I sat down and began to make up poems and play Panduri…” “I took you Panduri, sang a song about you!”
                In these mountainous regions, those who were skilled with the instrument were loved dearly and greatly respected among all. 
                No celebrations and occasions of amusement would take place without him. The long and full history
                of this instrument and the beautiful sounds it can produce have led to its preservation through the rocky history of its region of origin. To this day the instrument is 
                handed down and has become popularized on the internet via YouTube and other forums. Modern day artists like Trio Mandili have brought light to the ancient traditions 
                and music in a youthful and harmonious way.
